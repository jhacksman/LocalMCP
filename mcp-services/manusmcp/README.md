# ManusMCP

An AI agent framework using Flowise to deploy AI team members with specialized capabilities.

**Note**: Tested with Anthropic models only. [Reason](https://x.com/barre_of_lube/status/1901661792667103351)

## What is ManusMCP?

ManusMCP is a framework for orchestrating specialized AI agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables these agents to collaborate effectively by providing a shared context and communication layer.
