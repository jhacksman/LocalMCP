# Core Architecture Comparison: ManusMCP vs manus-open

## ManusMCP Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Framework**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Agent Orchestration**: Flowise
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: MCP SDK for server implementation
  - `playwright`: Browser automation
  - `zod`: Schema validation
  - `express`: HTTP server

### Architecture Pattern
- **MCP Server-based**: Implements a Model Context Protocol server that exposes tools for AI agents
- **Tool-based API**: Each capability is exposed as a "tool" with defined input/output schemas
- **Service-oriented**: Functionality is organized into services (FileService, ShellService, BrowserService)
- **Agent Flow**: Uses Flowise for visual agent flow configuration

### Communication Model
- **Stdio Transport**: Uses standard input/output for communication with AI models
- **Tool Registration**: Tools are registered with the MCP server and exposed to AI models
- **JSON Schema**: Uses Zod for schema validation of tool inputs/outputs

## manus-open Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Communication**: WebSockets
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `fastapi`: API framework
  - `websockets`: Real-time communication
  - `browser-use`: Browser automation
  - `pydantic`: Data validation

### Architecture Pattern
- **Containerized Sandbox**: Runs in an isolated Docker container
- **API-based**: Exposes capabilities through RESTful API endpoints
- **WebSocket Terminal**: Real-time terminal interaction through WebSockets
- **Proxy Services**: API proxy for external service access

### Communication Model
- **HTTP/WebSocket**: Uses HTTP for API calls and WebSockets for real-time communication
- **JSON Responses**: Structured JSON responses for all API calls
- **Event-driven**: WebSocket events for terminal and browser interactions

## Key Differences

1. **Protocol Approach**:
   - ManusMCP: Uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized AI tool integration
   - manus-open: Uses custom FastAPI endpoints and WebSockets

2. **Language & Runtime**:
   - ManusMCP: TypeScript with Bun runtime
   - manus-open: Python with standard Python runtime

3. **Agent Orchestration**:
   - ManusMCP: Uses Flowise for visual agent flow configuration
   - manus-open: Direct API integration without visual orchestration

4. **Isolation Model**:
   - ManusMCP: Process-level isolation
   - manus-open: Container-level isolation with Docker

5. **Communication Pattern**:
   - ManusMCP: Stdio-based communication with JSON schemas
   - manus-open: HTTP/WebSocket communication with structured JSON

## Integration Potential

1. **Containerization**:
   - manus-open's Docker-based isolation could enhance ManusMCP's security model
   - Container orchestration could provide better resource management

2. **WebSocket Communication**:
   - Real-time communication for terminal and browser interactions
   - Event-driven architecture for more responsive user experience

3. **Structured API Responses**:
   - Consistent JSON response format across all services
   - Better error handling and status reporting

4. **Proxy Services**:
   - API proxy for external service access with rate limiting and authentication
   - Enhanced security for third-party API integration

## Conclusion

ManusMCP and manus-open represent fundamentally different architectural approaches to solving similar problems. ManusMCP leverages the Model Context Protocol for standardized AI tool integration, while manus-open uses a more traditional API-based approach with WebSockets for real-time communication.

There is no evidence of code sharing or derivation between the two implementations. They appear to be independently developed solutions with different architectural philosophies.

The integration potential lies primarily in adopting manus-open's containerization, WebSocket communication, structured API responses, and proxy services to enhance ManusMCP's capabilities while maintaining its MCP-based architecture.
