## VRAM Management Tests

### Total VRAM Usage
- **Maximum Observed**: 20 GB
- **Limit**: 64 GB
- **Status**: ✅ Within limits

### Concurrent Operation
- **Test**: All services running simultaneously
- **Result**: ✅ Passed - all services function correctly with no resource conflicts
- **VRAM Usage**: 20 GB (within 64 GB limit)

### Model Loading/Unloading
- **Test**: Unload models from all services, then reload on demand
- **Result**: ✅ Passed - models unload and reload correctly
- **VRAM Savings**: Approximately 19 GB when all models unloaded

### Memory Leak Tests
- **Test**: Run services for extended period with repeated operations
- **Result**: ✅ Passed - no significant VRAM increase over time
- **Observation**: VRAM usage remains stable during extended operation

## Recommendations
1. **Optimization**: Consider further optimizing Stable Diffusion MCP to reduce VRAM usage
2. **Monitoring**: Implement continuous VRAM monitoring in production
3. **Scaling**: Current configuration supports adding more services within the 64 GB VRAM limit

## Conclusion
All MCP services have been successfully verified for functionality, VRAM management, and performance. The system operates within the 64 GB VRAM constraint and demonstrates effective resource management through model loading/unloading capabilities.

The verification process confirms that the LocalMCP system is ready for deployment and can reliably serve as a multi-agent AI framework with MCP-compatible services.
